### Requirements
- Docker v20.10.12 (including docker compose)
- Install the dependencies requirements:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements/local.txt
$ pre-commit install
```

## Local setup
First, you need to build the docker images for the project. You can do it using the following command:
```bash
$ make build
```
It may take some minutes if you run it for the first time.

After that, you can run the containers with:
```bash
$ make up
```

### Migrations and User creation
To run commands that involve calling the `manage.py` file, you can use a temporal django
container where you can execute these commands. Run the following commands to create migrations,
apply them and create a superuser:
```bash
$ make makemigrations
$ make migrate
$ make createsuperuser
```
After that, you will be prompted for the credentials for the new user, as you normally would.
Then, you can login into the admin at [http://0.0.0.0:8000/admin](http://0.0.0.0:8000/admin)
or [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin).
